Erco is a senior scientist in bioinformatics. He has 15 years experience both in academics and industry. He has devised and implemented algorithm to compute RNA secondary structure with a special focus on the influence of secondary structure on RNA-RNA interactions. He has been assembling and annotating genomes and transcriptome from higher eukaryotes, fungi, bacteria and archaea.

His current interests encompass transcriptome analysis and assembly, genome annotation, comparative genomics of extremophiles, CNV and environmental adaptation in plant and fungi, design of analysis pipelines for -omics data. Recently the analysis of metagenomes on work of arts and the story that the microbiome can tell about the geolocation of artefacts has captured his attention.

On his spare-time he rows, bicycles and takes care of his family and garden.
