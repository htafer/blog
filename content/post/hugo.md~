I am starting to blog from emacs and the org-mode and publish the posts on my github-hosted page.
Below I list a of link that helped me to set everything up:

-   [hugo installation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)

-   [Academic theme install](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/#install-with-zip)

-   [ox-hugo mode for emacs](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/)

Since I document my work in org-formatted file, this setup helps me to
achieve both documentation and blog publication in one single step.
