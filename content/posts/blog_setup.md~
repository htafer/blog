## HUGO {#hugo}

HUGO is a **fast** static site generator. I mainly document my work with
org-mode in emacs. In this first post I document my steps to automatize
the process of exporting org files into a static site hosted on github


### Requirements {#requirements}

In this blog post I document how
I configured

Go-lang-1.11 is necessary for Hugo. In Ubuntu-18.04 we need to install it from the
repository below

Check the following page
<https://www.kengrimes.com/ox-hugo-tutorial/> Start with this one
<https://www.zcl.space/tools/my-blog-workflow/>
<http://ianfitzpatrick.eu/post/blog-setup/> org-mode / emacs / hugo (academic) ox-hugo

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install golang-go
```

After that we can install the latest hugo binary (v0.53)

```bash
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.53/hugo_0.53_Linux-64bit.deb
sudo dpkg -i hugo_0.53_Linux-64bit.deb
```

Hugo themes can be downloaded directlry into the working directory

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes.git themes
```
