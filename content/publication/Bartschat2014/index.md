abstract = "MOTIVATION: Although small nucleolar RNAs form an important class of non-coding RNAs no comprehensive annotation efforts have been undertaken, presumably because the task is complicated by both the large number of distinct snoRNA families and their relatively rapid pace of sequence evolution. RESULTS: With snoStrip we present an automatic annotation pipeline developed specifically for comparative genomics of snoRNAs. It makes use of sequence conservation, canonical box motifs, as well as secondary structure and predicts putative targets. AVAILABILITY: The snoStrip web service and the download version is available at http://snostrip.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/ CONTACT: sebastian@bioinf.uni-leipzig.de."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
