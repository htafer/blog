abstract = "A computational screen for novel small nucleolar RNAs in Drosophila melanogaster uncovered 15 novel snoRNAs and snoRNA-like long non-coding RNAs. In contrast to earlier surverys, the novel sequences are mostly poorly conserved and originate from unusual genomic locations. The majority derive from precurors antisense to well-known protein-coding genes, and four of the candidates are produced from exon-coding regions. Only a minority of the new sequences appears to have canonical target sites in ribosomal or small nuclear RNAs. Taken together, these evolutionary young, poorly conserved, and genomically atypical sequences point at a class of snoRNA-like transcripts with predominantly regulatory functions in the fruit fly genome."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
