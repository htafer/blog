abstract = "Exophiala dermatitidis, a black yeast, is a widespread polyextremophile and human pathogen. The fungus can be isolated from extreme natural habitats and man- made extreme environments such as dishwashers or sauna facilities. It can cause various diseases ranging from cutaneous, subcutaneous and systemic infections with a fatality rate of 40. While the number of cases in immune- compromised patients is increasing, detailed understanding of the infections, virulence factors and host response is scarce. In this study an artificial skin infection on ex- vivo skin models was conducted in order to monitor the infection microscopically and analyze the changes in the transcriptome through RNA sequencing. Results show, that Exophiala dermatitidis was able to actively grow on and into ex-vivo skin models. Assembly of the RNA-sequencing data delivers a rich and complex transcriptome where circular RNAs, fusion transcripts, long non-coding RNAs and antisense transcripts are found. Changes in transcriptions primarily affected pathways related to nutrients acquisition, energy metabolism, cell wall, shape switch and secondary metabolites. Differential regulation of virulence-related genes was observed and the specific pathway for melanin upregulating during infection was determined. Hence our study is the first that gives an insight into the complexity of the transcriptome of Exophiala dermatitidis and the virulence mechanisms used by this fungus to successfully infect the ex-vivo skin models"

The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
