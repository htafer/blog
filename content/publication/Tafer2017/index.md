abstract = "Cladophialophora immunda is an ascomycotal species belonging to the group of the black yeasts. These fungi have a thick and melanized cell wall and other physiological adaptations that allows them to cope with several extreme physical and chemical conditions. Member of the group can colonize some of the most extremophilic environments on Earth. Cladophialophora immunda together with a few other species of the order Chaetothyriales show a special association with hydrocarbon polluted environments. The finding that the fungus is able to completely mineralize toluene makes it an interesting candidate for bioremediation purposes. The present study is the first transcriptomic investigation of a fungus grown in presence of toluene as sole carbon and energy source. We could observe the activation of genes involved in toluene degradatation and several stress response mechanisms which allowed the fungus to survive the toluene exposure. The thorough comparative genomics analysis allowed us to identify several events of horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and Cladophialophora immunda and unveil toluene degradation steps that were previously reported in bacteria. The work presented here aims to give new insights into the ecology of Cladophialophora immunda and its adaptation strategies to hydrocarbon polluted environments."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
