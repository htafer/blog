abstract = "The black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis is a worldwide distributed agent of primary and secondary diseases in both immunocompromised and healthy humans, with a high prevalence in human-made environments. Since thermo-tolerance has a crucial role in the fungus persistence in man-dominated habitat and in its pathogenicity, three incubation temperatures (37, 45, 1 Â°C) and two time spans (1 h, 1 week) were selected to simulate different environmental conditions and to investigate the effect of temperature on the proteome of E. dermatitidis CBS 525.76. Using a novel protocol for protein extraction from black yeasts, 2-D DIGE could be applied for characterization of changes in total protein spot abundance among the experimental conditions. A total of 32 variable proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Data about protein functions, localization and pathways were also obtained. A typical stress response under non-optimal temperature could not be observed at the proteome level, whereas a reduction of the metabolic activity, mostly concerning processes as the general carbon metabolism, was detected after exposure to cold. These results suggest that a fine protein modulation takes place following temperature treatment and a repertoire of stable protein might be at the base of E. dermatitidis adaptation to altered growth conditions. Significance: E. dermatitidis is a pathogenic black yeast causing neurotropic infections, systemic and subcutaneous disease in a wide range of hosts, including humans. The discovery of the fungus high prevalence in man-made habitats, including sauna facilities, drinking water and dishwashers, generated concern and raised questions about the infection route. In the present work - which is the first contribution on E. dermatitidis proteome - the effect of different temperature conditions on the fungus protein pattern have been analyzed by using a gel-based approach and the temperature responsive proteins have been identified.The absence of a typical stress response following the exposure to non-optimal temperature was detected at the proteome level, along with a general reduction of the metabolic activity after exposure to cold. These results suggest that a very fine regulation of the protein expression as well as adaptations involving a basic set of stable proteins may be at the base of E. dermatitidis enormous ecological plasticity, which plays a role in the fungus distribution, also enabling the transition from natural to human habitat and to the human host."
