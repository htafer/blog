abstract = "Enabled by rapid advances in sequencing technology, metagenomic studies aim to characterize entire communities of microbes$ackslash$r bypassing the need for culturing individual bacterial members. One major goal of such studies is to identify specific functional$ackslash$r adaptations of microbial communities to their habitats. Here we describe a powerful analytical method (MetaPath) that can$ackslash$r identify differentially abundant pathways in metagenomic data-sets, relying on a combination of metagenomic sequence data$ackslash$r and prior metabolic pathway knowledge. We show that MetaPath outperforms other common approaches when evaluated on simulated$ackslash$r datasets. We also demonstrate the power of our methods in analyzing two, publicly available, metagenomic datasets: a comparison$ackslash$r of the gut microbiome of obese and lean twins; and a comparison of the gut microbiome of infant and adult subjects. We demonstrate$ackslash$r that the subpathways identified by our method provide valuable insights into the biological activities of the microbiome."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
