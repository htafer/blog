abstract = "The avalanche of next generation sequencing data has led to a rapid increase of annotated microRNAs in the last few years. Many of them are specific to individual species or rather narrow clades. A closer inspection of the current version of miRBase shows that dozens of entries conflict with other ncRNAs, in particular snoRNAs. With few exceptions, these cases show little similarities to canonical microRNAs, however, and thus they should be considered as mis-annotations."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
