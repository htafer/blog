To this aim we will use the R-package pathview, which \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;maps and renders a wide variety of biological data on relevant pathway graphs. All users need is to supply their data and specify the target pathway. Pathview automatically downloads the pathway graph data, parses the data file, maps user data to the pathway, and render pathway graph with the mapped data. In addition, Pathview also seamlessly integrates with pathway and gene set (enrichment) analysis tools for large-scale and fully automated analysis\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo;. Since the annotation of the plant of interest might not be complete, the peptide mapping process was achieved by also considering protein from other plants, i.e. from more than one organism.\nThe problem is that pathview either works with a species specific set of genes ID or with the corresponding KEGGID. A solution is to convert the gene ID to KEGG ID. To this aim we generated a gene ID to EC dictionary from the IPR annotation. The EC to KEGG was obtained the KEGG Rest Api:\ncurl -f http://rest.kegg.jp/link/ec/ko | sed -r 's/ko://' | sed -r 's/ec:/EC:/' \u0026gt; KO2EC.list #KO2EC file looks then like #KEGG EC #K00001 EC:1.1.1.1 #K00002 EC:1.1.1.2 #K00003 EC:1.1.1.3 #K00004 EC:1.1.1.4 #K00004 EC:1.1.1.303 #K00005 EC:1.1.1.6 #K00006 EC:1.1.1.8 #K00007 EC:1.1.1.11 #K00008 EC:1.1.1.14  Code Snippet 1: Downloading KO / EC file  Finally the enrichment files have the following formatting\n\u0026quot;KEGGID\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Pvalue\u0026quot; \u0026quot;OddsRatio\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ExpCount\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Count\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Size\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Term\u0026quot; \u0026quot;fdr\u0026quot; \u0026quot;desc\u0026quot; \u0026quot;genes\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ko00630\u0026quot; 1.48869690281379e-05 8.83636363636364 1.69491525423729 9 25 NA 0.000699687544322481 \u0026quot;Glyoxylate_and_dicarboxylate_metabolism\u0026quot; \u0026quot;A0A067JFR1, A0A067JMA6, A0A067K0M8, A0A067KN15, A5X4N8, C6F1E5, K9MCB1, Q84XZ9, W9SPU5\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ko00020\u0026quot; 3.35093741041604e-05 11.8849902534113 1.08474576271186 7 16 NA 0.00078747029144777 \u0026quot;Citrate_cycle_(TCA_cycle)\u0026quot; \u0026quot;A0A067JFR1, A0A067JMA6, A0A067JUK1, A0A067K488, A0A067LBG3, A0A0B2SEY3, I1MGE6\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ko00720\u0026quot; 0.000359810652978868 7.08187134502924 1.49152542372881 7 22 NA 0.00485214527417342 \u0026quot;Carbon_fixation_pathways_in_prokaryotes\u0026quot; \u0026quot;A0A067JFR1, A0A067JMA6, A0A067JUK1, A0A067LBG3, A0A0B2SEY3, I1MGE6, J9Y1K3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ko00380\u0026quot; 0.000412948533972206 12.3446327683616 0.745762711864407 5 11 NA 0.00485214527417342 \u0026quot;Tryptophan_metabolism\u0026quot; \u0026quot;A0A067K488, C6F1E5, K9MCB1, Q84XZ9, W9SPU5\u0026quot;  PROCESSING Once we have the set of enriched KEGG pathway with the corresponding gene name, the conversion files from GeneID-\u0026gt;EC-\u0026gt;KEGGID, we can start genering colorised KEGG pathways.\n#In work2/fatemeh/proteinFunctionalAnnotation/enrichment2 #Library used to colorise KEGG pathways library(pathwview) #Read in the GENE-\u0026gt;EC dictionary dictUniEC\u0026lt;-read.table(\u0026quot;./helperfile/Gene_EC.dictionary\u0026quot;,header=T) #Read the EC2KO dictionary dictECKEGGID\u0026lt;-read.table(\u0026quot;/media/htafer/work2/share/database/KO2EC.list\u0026quot;,header=T) #Replace EC: with \u0026quot;\u0026quot; dictECKEGGID$EC\u0026lt;-gsub(\u0026quot;EC:\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,dictECKEGGID$EC) #Get the list of files containing enriched KEGG files\u0026lt;-list.files(path=\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;,pattern=\u0026quot;list.KEGG.csv$\u0026quot;) #for each file for (f in files){ # get the data data\u0026lt;-read.table(f,quote='\u0026quot;',header=T) # select enrichment q-balue \u0026lt; 0.05 data\u0026lt;-data[data$fdr\u0026lt;0.05,] # replace ko with \u0026quot;\u0026quot; data$KEGGID\u0026lt;-gsub(\u0026quot;ko\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,data$KEGGID) # replace ec with EC data$ECs\u0026lt;-gsub(\u0026quot;ec:\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;EC:\u0026quot;,data$genes) # for each gene inside the enriched annotation for(i in 1:dim(data)[1]){ #Get contig for give kegg contigs\u0026lt;-strsplit(as.character(data$ECs),\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;)[[i]] #Rmove white space contigs\u0026lt;-gsub(\u0026quot; \u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,contigs) #id conversion temp\u0026lt;-unique(dictECKEGGID$KEGG[dictECKEGGID$EC %in% unique(dictUniEC$ec[dictUniEC$uni %in% contigs])]) # #Read dictionary # # matchLOC\u0026lt;-dictLOCEC[dictLOCEC$EC %in% contigs,1] # #Remove the loc part since it is not used in KEGG # contigs\u0026lt;-gsub(\u0026quot;LOC\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,matchLOC) # #Start analysis # pathview(contig,pathway.id=sprintf(\u0026quot;%05s\u0026quot;,data$KEGGID[i]),species=\u0026quot;jcu\u0026quot;,out.suffix=paste(data$KEGGID[i],\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;,gsub(\u0026quot; \u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,data$ECs[i]),sep=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)) #Plot with pathview try(pathview(as.character(temp),pathway.id=data$KEGGID[i],species=\u0026quot;ko\u0026quot;,gene.idtype=\u0026quot;kegg\u0026quot;,plot.col.key= FALSE,out.suffix=paste(data$KEGGID[i],f,sep=\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;))) } }  Code Snippet 2: R-code used to colorize the overrpresented KEGG pathways with the correspponding enzymes  RESULTS The resulting pathways are now showing in red the genes with at least one peptide.\n\n  Figure 1: Colorized KEGG pathway rendered by pathview   Conclusion Pathview is a great tool to annotate metabolic pathway from KEGG.

The next few paragraph present an overview of the step we are doing:\nBasecalling on CPU Until recently Albacore was the official basecaller from ONT. This is now archived and guppy is the new preferred software for everything basecalling. Guppy can run both on the CPU and GPU (Nvidia only).

Before using the MX150 for basecalling, I configured my system to use the integrated for display and the nvidia card for compute. Base Ubuntu configuration for the t480 was taken from the great Luca\u0026rsquo;s Blog. Since I have Ubuntu 18.04 but Guppy\u0026rsquo;s GPU-version is currently only working in Ubuntu under Ubuntu 16.04 I followed the same path as the recently blog post of Winston Koh. He uses a nvidia docker image with cuda and CNN under Ubuntu 16 and subsequently installs guppy via the dpkg installer.\nWe first configured the Nvidia/Intel dual GPU system as reported in alexlee-gk gist.\nA list of annotated command is found below:\n# Download nvidia driver https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us sudo bash ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-410.93.run --no-opengl-files  Code Snippet 1: Driver installation in the laptop  The Nvidia-Docker installation is covered by SH Tsang Blog Post.

Historic—and also new built—pipe organs combine all those materials. In this study, halotolerant aspergilli and penicillia with low optimal temperatures were shown to be the most frequent invaders of pipe organs. The fungi form white mycelia on the organic components of the organs with a clear preference for the bolus paint of the wooden pipes, the leather-made hinges of the stop actions and all parts fixed by organic glue. Physiological tests showed that the strains isolated from the instruments all show a halotolerant behavior, although none was halophilic. The optimum growth temperature is below 20 °C, thus the fungi are perfectly adapted to the cool and relatively dry conditions in the churches and organs respectively. The de-novo genome sequences analyses of the strains are currently ongoing and will reveal the genomic basis for the halotolerant behavior of the fungi.","tags":[],"title":"Big sound and extreme fungi-xerophilic, halotolerant aspergilli and penicillia with low optimal temperature as invaders of historic pipe organs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Justyna Adamiak","Anna Otlewska","Hakim Tafer","Ksenija Lopandic","Beata Gutarowska","Katja Sterflinger","Guadalupe Pinar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546214400,"objectID":"ef539d6a606c4782a8e8ec52650fb07e","permalink":"https://htafer.github.io/publication/tafer2018deterioration/","publishdate":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tafer2018deterioration/","section":"publication","summary":"The aim of this study was to detect the community structure of Bacteria and Archaea, especially halophilic microorganisms, involved in the biodeterioration of historic building materials, as brick and paint coating. The Ion Torrent™ sequencing technology platform was used for the first time to analyse these materials. Amplicons were generated by using universal, bacteria- and archaea-specific primers, all flanking the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rDNA, in order to compare the sensitivity of taxon detection. Results showed that the Ion Torrent™ sequencing platform has an enormous potential to evaluate the microbiome of historic building materials in a fast and easy way. The brick sample displayed a total of 1178 genera belonging to 27 bacterial and 3 archaeal phyla, while the paint coating showed 145 genera belonging to 11 bacterial phyla. Members of the Actinobacteria were dominant in both samples. Halophiles were detected in both materials showing to be important colonizers when salty micro-niches are available in the surfaces of the buildings. Nevertheless, analyses showed to be influenced by the primer choice, and bacteria- and archaea-specific primers confirmed the occurrence of primer bias, as they enabled the unspecific detection of Archaea and Bacteria. The results derived from universal and archaeal-specific primers were comparable, except for Nitrospirae, detected only using universal primers. These data clearly showed the impact of primer choice on the structure of the microbial communities, pointing out the need of a carefully choice of primers. Therefore, we recommend using, in addition to the universal primers, bacteria- and archaea-specific primers in order to cover a higher taxonomic diversity.","tags":[],"title":"First evaluation of the microbiome of built cultural heritage by using the Ion Torrent next generation sequencing platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C Poyntner","U Mirastschijski","K Sterflinger","H Tafer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546214400,"objectID":"829a8e9bd211f2e9a808230591e801e5","permalink":"https://htafer.github.io/publication/tafer2018exo/","publishdate":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tafer2018exo/","section":"publication","summary":"The black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis is a polyextremophilic human pathogen, especially known for growing in man-made extreme environments.

To understand the impact of the putative virulence factor melanin on the infection, we generated a polyketide synthase (PKS1) mutant using CRISPR/Cas9 resulting in a melanin deficient strain. The mutant and the wild-type fungus were inoculated onto skin explants using an ex vivo skin organ culture model to simulate in vivo cutaneous infection. The difference between the mutant and wild-type transcriptional landscapes, as assessed by whole RNA-sequencing, were small and were observed in pathways related to the copper homeostasis, cell wall genes and proteases. Seven days after inoculation the wild-type fungus completely colonized the stratum corneum, invaded the skin and infected keratinocytes while the mutant had only partially covered the skin and showed no invasiveness. Our results suggest that melanin dramatically improves the invasiveness and virulence of E. dermatitidis during the first days of the skin infection.","tags":[],"title":"Transcriptome study of an Exophiala dermatitidis PKS1 mutant on an ex vivo skin model: Is melanin important for infection?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hakim Tafer","Guadalupe Pinar","Caroline Poyntner","Katja Sterflinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544533200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544533200,"objectID":"13b37be345f7fecfeaca61af634f4df0","permalink":"https://htafer.github.io/talk/leonardo2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-11T14:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/leonardo2018/","section":"talk","summary":"We report on the population genomics derived from Whole Genome Nanopore Sequencing of the microbiome of the Codice del Volo from Leonardo da Vinci.

RESULTS We release the 34.7 Mbp draft genome of Chaetomium cochliodes CCM F-232 consisting of 6036 contigs with an average size of 5756 bp and reconstructed its phylogeny. We show that this filamentous fungus is closely related but not identical to Chaetomium globosum and Chaetomium elatum. We screened and critically analysed this genome for open reading frames coding for essential antioxidant enzymes. It is demonstrated that the genome of C. cochliodes contains genes encoding putative enzymes from all four known heme peroxidase superfamilies including bifunctional catalase-peroxidase (KatG), cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP), manganese peroxidase, two paralogs of hybrid B peroxidases (HyBpox), cyclooxygenase, linoleate diol synthase, dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) of type B and three paralogs of heme thiolate peroxidases. Both KatG and DyP-type B are shown to be introduced into ascomycetes genomes by horizontal gene transfer from various bacteria. In addition, two putative large subunit secretory and two small-subunit typical catalases are found in C. cochliodes. We support our genomic findings with quantitative transcription analysis of nine peroxidase  catalase genes.

These compounds were chosen as representatives of relevant environmental pollutants. A microtiter plate-based culture assay was set up in order to screen the fungal strains for growth on the selected xenobiotics versus glucose, as a positive control. Growth was observed in 25 strains on at least two of the tested substrates. Confirmation of substrate assimilation was performed by cultivation on closed vials and analysis of the headspace composition with regard to the added volatile substrates and the generated carbon dioxide. Exophiala mesophila (CBS 120910) and Cladophialophora immunda (CBS 110551), both of the order Chaetothyriales and isolated from a patient with chronic sinusitis and a polluted soil sample, respectively, showed the ability to grow on toluene as the sole carbon and energy source. Toluene assimilation has previously been described for C. immunda but this is the first account for E. mesophila. Also, this is the first time that the capacity to grow on alkylbenzenes has been demonstrated for a clinical isolate. Assimilation of toluene could not be demonstrated for the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudoallescheria boydii (CBS 115.59, Microascales), but the results from microtiter plate assays suggest that strains of this species are promising candidates for further studies. The outstanding abilities of black yeast-like fungi to thrive in extreme environments makes them ideal agents for the bioremediation of polluted soils, and for the treatment of contaminated gas streams in biofilters. However, interrelations between hydrocarbonoclastic and potentially pathogenic strains need to be elucidated in order to avoid the possibility of biohazards occurring.","tags":[],"title":"Pathogenic yet environmentally friendly? black fungal candidates for bioremediation of pollutants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caroline Poyntner","Barbara Blasi","Elsa Arcalis","Ursula Mirastschijski","Katja Sterflinger","Hakim Tafer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483142400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483142400,"objectID":"d4b5b8317549afbe3f88bb231360c2d0","permalink":"https://htafer.github.io/publication/tafer2016skin/","publishdate":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tafer2016skin/","section":"publication","summary":"Exophiala dermatitidis, a black yeast, is a widespread polyextremophile and human pathogen.

Defining their expression strategies and the full repertory of their biological functions is a critical, but still ongoing, process in most organisms. Considering that Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most advantageous model organism for genetic, functional and developmental studies, we analysed the whole genomic organization of its annotated snoRNAs - whose vast majority is known to be embedded in an intronic context - and show by GO term enrichment analysis that protein-coding genes involved in cell division and cytoskeleton organization are those mostly preferred as hosts. This finding was unexpected, and delineates an unpredicted link between snoRNA host genes and cell proliferation that might be of general relevance. We also defined by quantitative RT-PCR the expression of a representative subset of annotated specimens throughout the life cycle, providing a first overview on developmental profiling of the fly snoRNA transcriptome. We found that most of the tested specimens, rather than acting as housekeeping genes with uniform expression, exhibit dynamic developmental expression patterns; moreover, intronic snoRNAs harboured by the same host gene often exhibit distinct temporal profiles, indicating that they can be expressed uncoordinatedly. In addition to provide an updated outline of the fly snoRNA transcriptome, our data highlight that expression of these versatile ncRNAs can be finely regulated.","tags":[],"title":"Developmentally regulated expression and expression strategies of Drosophila snoRNAs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katja Sterflinger","Ksenija Lopandic","Barbara Blasi","Caroline Poynter","Sybren Hoog","Hakim Tafer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451520000,"objectID":"214f4d0400696c9daf6012735eed2d3c","permalink":"https://htafer.github.io/publication/tafer2015a/","publishdate":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tafer2015a/","section":"publication","summary":"The fungal genus Cladophialophora comprises many species which cause severe and even fatal infections in humans as well as environmental strains able to degrade polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

Thanks in part to its thick and strongly melanized cell walls, E. dermatitidis is extremely tolerant to various kinds of stress, including extreme pH, temperature and desiccation. E. dermatitidis is also the agent responsible for various severe illnesses in humans, such as pneumonia and keratitis, and might lead to fatal brain infections. Due to its association with the human environment, its poly-extremophilic lifestyle and its pathogenicity in humans, E. dermatitidis has become an important model organism. In this study we present the functional analysis of the transcriptional response of the fungus at 1°C and 45°C, in comparison with that at 37°C, for two different exposition times, i.e. 1 hour and 1 week. At 1°C, E. dermatitidis uses a large repertoire of tools to acclimatize, such as lipid membrane fluidization, trehalose production or cytoskeleton rearrangement, which allows the fungus to remain metabolically active. At 45°C, the fungus drifts into a replicative state and increases the activity of the Golgi apparatus. As a novel finding, our study provides evidence that, apart from the protein coding genes, non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs as well as fusion-transcripts are differentially regulated and that the function of the fusion-transcripts can be related to the corresponding temperature condition. This work establishes that E. dermatitidis adapts to its environment by modulating coding and non-coding gene transcription levels and through the regulation of chimeric and circular RNAs.","tags":[],"title":"From Glacier to Sauna: RNA-Seq of the Human Pathogen Black Fungus Exophiala dermatitidis under Varying Temperature Conditions Exhibits Common and Novel Fungal Response.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Donatella Tesei","Gorji Marzban","Martina Marchetti-Deschmann","Hakim Tafer","Elsa Arcalis","Katja Sterflinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451520000,"objectID":"6937f0e8f2689ecd8a767fd839893436","permalink":"https://htafer.github.io/publication/tesei2015a/","publishdate":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tesei2015a/","section":"publication","summary":"The black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis is a worldwide distributed agent of primary and secondary diseases in both immunocompromised and healthy humans, with a high prevalence in human-made environments. Since thermo-tolerance has a crucial role in the fungus persistence in man-dominated habitat and in its pathogenicity, three incubation temperatures (37, 45, 1 °C) and two time spans (1 h, 1 week) were selected to simulate different environmental conditions and to investigate the effect of temperature on the proteome of E. dermatitidis CBS 525.76. Using a novel protocol for protein extraction from black yeasts, 2-D DIGE could be applied for characterization of changes in total protein spot abundance among the experimental conditions. A total of 32 variable proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Data about protein functions, localization and pathways were also obtained. A typical stress response under non-optimal temperature could not be observed at the proteome level, whereas a reduction of the metabolic activity, mostly concerning processes as the general carbon metabolism, was detected after exposure to cold. These results suggest that a fine protein modulation takes place following temperature treatment and a repertoire of stable protein might be at the base of E. dermatitidis adaptation to altered growth conditions. Significance: E. dermatitidis is a pathogenic black yeast causing neurotropic infections, systemic and subcutaneous disease in a wide range of hosts, including humans. The discovery of the fungus high prevalence in man-made habitats, including sauna facilities, drinking water and dishwashers, generated concern and raised questions about the infection route. In the present work - which is the first contribution on E. dermatitidis proteome - the effect of different temperature conditions on the fungus protein pattern have been analyzed by using a gel-based approach and the temperature responsive proteins have been identified.The absence of a typical stress response following the exposure to non-optimal temperature was detected at the proteome level, along with a general reduction of the metabolic activity after exposure to cold. These results suggest that a very fine regulation of the protein expression as well as adaptations involving a basic set of stable proteins may be at the base of E. dermatitidis enormous ecological plasticity, which plays a role in the fungus distribution, also enabling the transition from natural to human habitat and to the human host.","tags":[],"title":"Proteome of tolerance fine-tuning in the human pathogen black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Agrisani","H Tafer","P F Stadler","M Furia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451520000,"objectID":"df5a9bb958aecaf136843aa1bc0f4cba","permalink":"https://htafer.github.io/publication/tafer2015snorna/","publishdate":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tafer2015snorna/","section":"publication","summary":"A computational screen for novel small nucleolar RNAs in Drosophila melanogaster uncovered 15 novel snoRNAs and snoRNA-like long non-coding RNAs.

The modification patterns are retained during evolution, making it even possible to project them from yeast onto human. The stringent conservation of modification sites and the slow evolution of rRNAs and snRNAs contradicts the rapid evolution of small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) sequences. To explain this discrepancy, we investigated the coevolution of snoRNAs and their targeted sites throughout vertebrates. To measure and evaluate the conservation of RNA-RNA interactions, we defined the interaction conservation index (ICI). It combines the quality of individual interaction with the scope of its conservation in a set of species and serves as an efficient measure to evaluate the conservation of the interaction of snoRNA and target. We show that functions of homologous snoRNAs are evolutionarily stable, thus, members of the same snoRNA family guide equivalent modifications. The conservation of snoRNA sequences is high at target binding regions while the remaining sequence varies significantly. In addition to elucidating principles of correlated evolution, we were able, with the help of the ICI measure, to assign functions to previously orphan snoRNAs and to associate snoRNAs as partners to known chemical modifications unassigned to a given snoRNA. Furthermore, we used predictions of snoRNA functions in conjunction with sequence conservation to identify distant homologies. Because of the high overall entropy of snoRNA sequences, such relationships are hard to detect by means of sequence homology search methods alone.","tags":[],"title":"Matching of soulmates: Coevolution of snoRNAs and their targets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Ettenauer","G Pinar","H Tafer","K Sterflinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1419984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1419984000,"objectID":"be3da5e5b7c659910717d7306071604c","permalink":"https://htafer.github.io/publication/tafer2014/","publishdate":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tafer2014/","section":"publication","summary":"The traditional methodology used for the identification of microbes colonizing our cultural heritage was the application of cultivation methods and/or microscopy. This approach has many advantages, as living microorganisms may be obtained for physiological investigations. In addition, these techniques allow the quantitative and qualitative assessment of the investigated environment. Quantitative analyses are done by plate count and the determination of abundance by the colony forming unit (CFU). Nevertheless, these techniques have many drawbacks that lead to an underestimation of the cell numbers and do not provide a comprehensive overview of the composition of the inhabiting microbiota. In the last decades, several molecular techniques have been developed enabling many advantages over the cultivation approach. Mainly PCR-based, fingerprinting techniques allow a qualitative detection and identification of the microbiota. In this study, we developed a real time PCR method as a simple, rapid and reliable tool to detect and quantify fungal abundance using the β-actin gene, which is known to appear as a single-copy gene in fungi. To this end, five different indoor thermal insulation materials applied for historical buildings that were previously tested for their bio-susceptibility against various fungi were subjected to qPCR analyses. The obtained results were compared with those obtained from a previous study investigating the bio-susceptibility of the insulation materials using classical cultivation experiments. Both results correlated well, revealing that Perlite plaster was the most suitable insulation material, showing the lowest fungal CFU and qPCR values. In contrast, insulations made of wood showed to be not recommendable from the microbiological point of view. In addition, the potential of qPCR was tested in other materials of cultural heritage, as old parchments, showing to be a suitable method for measuring fungal abundance in these delicate materials.","tags":[],"title":"Quantification of fungal abundance on cultural heritage using real time PCR targeting the $eta$-actin gene","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roman R.

They are highly structured, with large parts of the mol- ecules exhibiting very strong conservation of their base pairing patterns. Since also sequence conservation varies dramatically between different regions of rRNA genes, these data are informative on a wide range of phylogenetic timescales, ranging from recent to ancient splits. But individual columns of rRNA alignments are not inde- pendent. This is a consequence of biologically functional secondary structures with highly varying degrees of conservation. Therefore, any correlations within sequence alignments of structurally functional RNA will distort the phylogenetic signal and/or lead to gross overestimates of tree stability. On the other hand, alignment accuracy can be improved substantially by incorporating secondary structure conservation. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches are amenable to using RNA-specific substitution models that treat conserved base pairs appropriately, but they require accurate secondary structure models as input. Structure prediction algorithms for single RNA sequences are well known and widely used; but it is not straightforward to apply these predictions for phylogenetic purposes. The main limitation is that accuracy of thermodynamic folding algorithms declines sharply as the length of the RNA increases, this is in part due to inaccuracies within the thermodynamic folding parameters, in part caused by the kinetics of folding process and tertiary interac- tions, and even more in the fact that RNA and protein components of the ribosome are tightly packed and thus mutually influence their folds. The functional rRNA struc- tures, therefore, cannot reasonably be expected to be identical with the minimum free energy structures of isolated rRNAs computed by thermodynamic folding algorithms. Our RNAsalsa approach has been the first accurate and easy-to-use tool to address those implications mentioned. It is available for computing structure-aware align- ments and consensus structures and can deal with large sets of large rRNAs. Multiple pairwise sequence alignments, intersections with individualized structural constraint modeling, and computationally derived collections of optimized subgroup consen- sus structures allow to extract a refined individualized structure constraint for each single sequence by means of a majority voting procedure. That way an extensively optimized set of individual constraints serves in minimum energy folding to obtain the final structural annotation for each input sequence. Further, the structure-anno- tated input sequences are aligned by a structure-aware alignment method, resulting in a final alignment and a corresponding consensus structure which are ready for phylogenetic analysis based on RNA-specific substitution models. The difference to DNA substitution models is that structure-aware models consider pairs of nucleotides as their elementary states rather than single nucleotides. Further, studies suggest that RNA secondary structures are by themselves also phylogenetically informative since structural variations are specific to individual clades. This has been reported for a wide variety of non-coding RNAs, including rRNAs, 7SK RNAs, and mitochondrial tRNAs. But in all cases the massive epistasis needs to be taken into account explicitly which is introduced by strong selection on secondary structure features.","tags":[],"title":"RNA in phylogenetic reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Bartschat","Stephanie Kehr","Hakim Tafer","Peter F.

Currently, the human genome holds the best mammalian ncRNA annotation, a result of numerous efforts by several groups. However, a more direct strategy is desired for the increasing number of sequenced mammalian genomes of which some, such as the pig, are relevant as disease models and production animals.$ackslash$n$ackslash$nRESULTS: We present a comprehensive annotation of structured RNAs in the pig genome. Combining sequence and structure similarity search as well as class specific methods, we obtained a conservative set with a total of 3,391 structured RNA loci of which 1,011 and 2,314, respectively, hold strong sequence and structure similarity to structured RNAs in existing databases. The RNA loci cover 139 cis-regulatory element loci, 58 lncRNA loci, 11 conflicts of annotation, and 3,183 ncRNA genes. The ncRNA genes comprise 359 miRNAs, 8 ribozymes, 185 rRNAs, 638 snoRNAs, 1,030 snRNAs, 810 tRNAs and 153 ncRNA genes not belonging to the here fore mentioned classes. When running the pipeline on a local shuffled version of the genome, we obtained no matches at the highest confidence level. Additional analysis of RNA-seq data from a pooled library from 10 different pig tissues added another 165 miRNA loci, yielding an overall annotation of 3,556 structured RNA loci. This annotation represents our best effort at making an automated annotation. To further enhance the reliability, 571 of the 3,556 structured RNAs were manually curated by methods depending on the RNA class while 1,581 were declared as pseudogenes. We further created a multiple alignment of pig against 20 representative vertebrates, from which RNAz predicted 83,859 de novo RNA loci with conserved RNA structures. 528 of the RNAz predictions overlapped with the homology based annotation or novel miRNAs. We further present a substantial synteny analysis which includes 1,004 lineage specific de novo RNA loci and 4 ncRNA loci in the known annotation specific for Laurasiatheria (pig, cow, dolphin, horse, cat, dog, hedgehog).$ackslash$n$ackslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have obtained one of the most comprehensive annotations for structured ncRNAs of a mammalian genome, which is likely to play central roles in both health modelling and production.

Leafy beets have been cultivated since Roman times, but sugar beet is one of the most recently domesticated crops. It arose in the late eighteenth century when lines accumulating sugar in the storage root were selected from crosses made with chard and fodder beet. Here we present a reference genome sequence for sugar beet as the first non-rosid, non-asterid eudicot genome, advancing comparative genomics and phylogenetic reconstructions. The genome sequence comprises 567 megabases, of which 85 could be assigned to chromosomes. The assembly covers a large proportion of the repetitive sequence content that was estimated to be 63. We predicted 27,421 protein-coding genes supported by transcript data and annotated them on the basis of sequence homology. Phylogenetic analyses provided evidence for the separation of Caryophyllales before the split of asterids and rosids, and revealed lineage-specific gene family expansions and losses. We sequenced spinach (Spinacia oleracea), another Caryophyllales species, and validated features that separate this clade from rosids and asterids. Intraspecific genomic variation was analysed based on the genome sequences of sea beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima; progenitor of all beet crops) and four additional sugar beet accessions. We identified seven million variant positions in the reference genome, and also large regions of low variability, indicating artificial selection.

Wild pigs emerged in South East Asia and subsequently spread across Eurasia. Our results reveal a deep phylogenetic split between European and Asian wild boars ∼1 million years ago, and a selective sweep analysis indicates selection on genes involved in RNA processing and regulation. Genes associated with immune response and olfaction exhibit fast evolution. Pigs have the largest repertoire of functional olfactory receptor genes, reflecting the importance of smell in this scavenging animal.

However, the evolutionary roots of one intriguing group of insects, the twisted-wing parasites (Strepsiptera), remain unclear despite centuries of study and debate [1, 2, 4-11]. Strepsiptera exhibit exceptional larval developmental features, consistent with a predicted step from direct (hemimetabolous) larval development to complete metamorphosis that could have set the stage for the spectacular radiation of metamorphic (holometabolous) insects [1, 12, 13]. Here we report the sequencing of a Strepsiptera genome and show that the analysis of sequence-based genomic data (comprising more than 18 million nucleotides from nearly 4,500 genes obtained from a total of 13 insect genomes), along with genomic metacharacters, clarifies the phylogenetic origin of Strepsiptera and sheds light on the evolution of holometabolous insect development. Our results provide overwhelming support for Strepsiptera as the closest living relatives of beetles (Coleoptera). They demonstrate that the larval developmental features of Strepsiptera, reminiscent of those of hemimetabolous insects, are the result of convergence. Our analyses solve the long-standing enigma of the evolutionary roots of Strepsiptera and reveal that the holometabolous mode of insect development is more malleable than previously thought. extcopyright 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","tags":[],"title":"Genomic and morphological evidence converge to resolve the enigma of strepsiptera","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manja Marz","Andreas R.

It is already known that the assembly and activation of RISC is a crucial determinant of RNAi activity, but downstream effects such as target accessibility have not been analysed extensively. Therefore we assessed the effect of target site accessibility and found that it significantly improves the potency of siRNAs. Similarly, miRNAs (microRNAs) act by repressing protein synthesis through imperfect base-pairing to the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of target mRNAs. We found that predicted target sites reside in regions of high accessibility and tested whether this criterion could be used in the search of functional miRNA targets. In addition, we performed reporter gene assays to test whether accessibility correlates with measured mRNA suppression levels.

In this study we present a comprehensive analysis of target RNA structure effects on RNAi by computing the accessibility of the target site for interaction with the siRNA. Based on our observations, we developed a novel siRNA design tool, RNAxs, by combining known siRNA functionality criteria with target site accessibility. We calibrated our method on two data sets comprising 573 siRNAs for 38 genes, and tested it on an independent set of 360 siRNAs targeting four additional genes. Overall, RNAxs proves to be a robust siRNA selection tool that substantially improves the prediction of highly efficient siRNAs.","tags":[],"title":"The impact of target site accessibility on the design of effective siRNAs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["U MUCKSTEIN","Hakim TAFER","Stephan H Bernhart","Maribel Hernandez-Rosales","Jorg Vogel","Peter F Stadler","Ivo L Hofacker","Ulrike Mueckstein","Hakim TAFER","Stephan H Bernhart","Maribel Hernandez-Rosales","Jorg Vogel","Peter F Stadler","Ivo L Hofacker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230681600,"objectID":"7c2e4dc1a8ca53b688cc006c699dfab0","permalink":"https://htafer.github.io/publication/mueckstein08/","publishdate":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mueckstein08/","section":"publication","summary":"The thermodynamics of RNA-RNA interaction consists of two components: the energy necessary to make a potential binding region accessible, i.e. unpaired, and the energy gained from the base pairing of the two interaction partners. We show here that both components can be efficiently computed using an improved variant of RNAup. The method is then applied to a set of bacterial small RNAs involved in translational control. In all cases of biologically active sRNA target interactions, the target sites predicted by RNAup are in perfect agreement with literature. In addition to prediction of target site location, RNAup can also be used to determine the mode of sRNA action. Using information about target site location and the accessibility change resulting from sRNA binding we can discriminate between positive and negative regulators of translation.","tags":[],"title":"Translational Control by RNA-RNA Interaction: Improved Computation of RNA-RNA Binding Thermodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H Tafer","I L Hofacker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199059200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199059200,"objectID":"3f65857a4d70f11e5e8774ede3053c5b","permalink":"https://htafer.github.io/publication/tafer2007/","publishdate":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tafer2007/","section":"publication","summary":"On the basis of sequence-specific resonance assignments for the complete polypeptide backbone and most of the amino acid side chains by heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the urea-unfolded form of the outer membrane protein X (OmpX) from Escherichia coli has been structurally characterized.

In many cases, non-coding RNAs exert their function by binding to other nucleic acids, as in the case of microRNAs and snoRNAs. The specificity of these interactions derives from the stability of inter-molecular base pairing. The accurate computational treatment of RNA-RNA binding therefore lies at the heart of target prediction algorithms. METHODS: The standard dynamic programming algorithms for computing secondary structures of linear single-stranded RNA molecules are extended to the co-folding of two interacting RNAs. RESULTS: We present a program, RNAcofold, that computes the hybridization energy and base pairing pattern of a pair of interacting RNA molecules. In contrast to earlier approaches, complex internal structures in both RNAs are fully taken into account. RNAcofold supports the calculation of the minimum energy structure and of a complete set of suboptimal structures in an energy band above the ground state. Furthermore, it provides an extension of McCaskill's partition function algorithm to compute base pairing probabilities, realistic interaction energies, and equilibrium concentrations of duplex structures.","tags":[],"title":"Partition Function and Base Pairing Probabilities of RNA Heterodimers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ulrike Muckstein","Hakim Tafer","Jorg Hackermuller","Stephan H.
