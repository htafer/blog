      <description>I am starting to blog from emacs and the org-mode and publish the posts on my github-hosted page. Below I list a of link that helped me to set everything up:
 hugo installation
 Academic theme install
 ox-hugo mode for emacs
 Update of the blog on github
  Since I document my work in org-formatted file, this setup helps me to achieve both documentation and blog publication in one single step.</description>

      <description>I have been terminating a project where proteomic profiles of of a plant seed have been done at a various developmental stages. On of the question was to look at when which enzyme shows up in KEGG pathway.

      <description>Context We are currently sequencing old (500-1500 years old) statues, manuscripts and parchments in order to assess which microorganisms grow/grew on them. To this aim illumina, torrent and now nanopore sequencing are being used. Nanopore sequencing is being done in our lab. The main problem once we got the fast5 data is to basecall them and do further processing. The next few paragraph present an overview of the step we are doing:</description>
