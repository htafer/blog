      <description>I have been terminating a project where proteomic profiles of of a plant seed have been done at a various developmental stages. On of the question was to look at when which enzyme shows up in KEGG pathway.
DATA In terms of data we have for each stage a list of proteins with at least one protein-specific peptide. My main work was to look at this list of gene and find enriched functional annotation terms.</description>
