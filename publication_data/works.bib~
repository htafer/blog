abstract = {The aim of this study was to detect the community structure of Bacteria and Archaea, especially halophilic microorganisms, involved in the biodeterioration of historic building materials, as brick and paint coating. The Ion Torrent™ sequencing technology platform was used for the first time to analyse these materials. Amplicons were generated by using universal, bacteria- and archaea-specific primers, all flanking the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rDNA, in order to compare the sensitivity of taxon detection. Results showed that the Ion Torrent™ sequencing platform has an enormous potential to evaluate the microbiome of historic building materials in a fast and easy way. The brick sample displayed a total of 1178 genera belonging to 27 bacterial and 3 archaeal phyla, while the paint coating showed 145 genera belonging to 11 bacterial phyla. Members of the Actinobacteria were dominant in both samples. Halophiles were detected in both materials showing to be important colonizers when salty micro-niches are available in the surfaces of the buildings. Nevertheless, analyses showed to be influenced by the primer choice, and bacteria- and archaea-specific primers confirmed the occurrence of primer bias, as they enabled the unspecific detection of Archaea and Bacteria. The results derived from universal and archaeal-specific primers were comparable, except for Nitrospirae, detected only using universal primers. These data clearly showed the impact of primer choice on the structure of the microbial communities, pointing out the need of a carefully choice of primers. Therefore, we recommend using, in addition to the universal primers, bacteria- and archaea-specific primers in order to cover a higher taxonomic diversity.},

abstract = {The discovery of a living coelacanth specimen in 1938 was remarkable, as this lineage of lobe-finned fish was thought to have become extinct 70 million years ago. The modern coelacanth looks remarkably similar to many of its ancient relatives, and its evolutionary proximity to our own fish ancestors provides a glimpse of the fish that first walked on land. Here we report the genome sequence of the African coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. Through a phylogenomic analysis, we conclude that the lungfish, and not the coelacanth, is the closest living relative of tetrapods. Coelacanth protein-coding genes are significantly more slowly evolving than those of tetrapods, unlike other genomic features. Analyses of changes in genes and regulatory elements during the vertebrate adaptation to land highlight genes involved in immunity, nitrogen excretion and the development of fins, tail, ear, eye, brain and olfaction. Functional assays of enhancers involved in the fin-to-limb transition and in the emergence of extra-embryonic tissues show the importance of the coelacanth genome as a blueprint for understanding tetrapod evolution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Annotating mammalian genomes for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) is nontrivial since far from all ncRNAs are known and the computational models are resource demanding. Currently, the human genome holds the best mammalian ncRNA annotation, a result of numerous efforts by several groups. However, a more direct strategy is desired for the increasing number of sequenced mammalian genomes of which some, such as the pig, are relevant as disease models and production animals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present a comprehensive annotation of structured RNAs in the pig genome. Combining sequence and structure similarity search as well as class specific methods, we obtained a conservative set with a total of 3,391 structured RNA loci of which 1,011 and 2,314, respectively, hold strong sequence and structure similarity to structured RNAs in existing databases. The RNA loci cover 139 cis-regulatory element loci, 58 lncRNA loci, 11 conflicts of annotation, and 3,183 ncRNA genes. The ncRNA genes comprise 359 miRNAs, 8 ribozymes, 185 rRNAs, 638 snoRNAs, 1,030 snRNAs, 810 tRNAs and 153 ncRNA genes not belonging to the here fore mentioned classes. When running the pipeline on a local shuffled version of the genome, we obtained no matches at the highest confidence level. Additional analysis of RNA-seq data from a pooled library from 10 different pig tissues added another 165 miRNA loci, yielding an overall annotation of 3,556 structured RNA loci. This annotation represents our best effort at making an automated annotation. To further enhance the reliability, 571 of the 3,556 structured RNAs were manually curated by methods depending on the RNA class while 1,581 were declared as pseudogenes. We further created a multiple alignment of pig against 20 representative vertebrates, from which RNAz predicted 83,859 de novo RNA loci with conserved RNA structures. 528 of the RNAz predictions overlapped with the homology based annotation or novel miRNAs. We further present a substantial synteny analysis which includes 1,004 lineage specific de novo RNA loci and 4 ncRNA loci in the known annotation specific for Laurasiatheria (pig, cow, dolphin, horse, cat, dog, hedgehog).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have obtained one of the most comprehensive annotations for structured ncRNAs of a mammalian genome, which is likely to play central roles in both health modelling and production. The core annotation is available in Ensembl 70 and the complete annotation is available at http://rth.dk/resources/rnannotator/susscr102/version1.02.},

abstract = {Exophiala dermatitidis (Wangiella dermatitidis) belongs to the group of the so-called black yeasts. Thanks in part to its thick and strongly melanized cell walls, E. dermatitidis is extremely tolerant to various kinds of stress, including extreme pH, temperature and desiccation. E. dermatitidis is also the agent responsible for various severe illnesses in humans, such as pneumonia and keratitis, and might lead to fatal brain infections. Due to its association with the human environment, its poly-extremophilic lifestyle and its pathogenicity in humans, E. dermatitidis has become an important model organism. In this study we present the functional analysis of the transcriptional response of the fungus at 1°C and 45°C, in comparison with that at 37°C, for two different exposition times, i.e. 1 hour and 1 week. At 1°C, E. dermatitidis uses a large repertoire of tools to acclimatize, such as lipid membrane fluidization, trehalose production or cytoskeleton rearrangement, which allows the fungus to remain metabolically active. At 45°C, the fungus drifts into a replicative state and increases the activity of the Golgi apparatus. As a novel finding, our study provides evidence that, apart from the protein coding genes, non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs as well as fusion-transcripts are differentially regulated and that the function of the fusion-transcripts can be related to the corresponding temperature condition. This work establishes that E. dermatitidis adapts to its environment by modulating coding and non-coding gene transcription levels and through the regulation of chimeric and circular RNAs.},

abstract = {A synergistic combination of two next-generation sequencing platforms with a detailed comparative BAC physical contig map provided a cost-effective assembly of the genome sequence of the domestic turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). Heterozygosity of the sequenced source genome allowed discovery of more than 600,000 high quality single nucleotide variants. Despite this heterozygosity, the current genome assembly (∼1.1 Gb) includes 917 Mb of sequence assigned to specific turkey chromosomes. Annotation identified nearly 16,000 genes, with 15,093 recognized as protein coding and 611 as non-coding RNA genes. Comparative analysis of the turkey, chicken, and zebra finch genomes, and comparing avian to mammalian species, supports the characteristic stability of avian genomes and identifies genes unique to the avian lineage. Clear differences are seen in number and variety of genes of the avian immune system where expansions and novel genes are less frequent than examples of gene loss. The turkey genome sequence provides resources to further understand the evolution of vertebrate genomes and genetic variation underlying economically important quantitative traits in poultry. This integrated approach may be a model for providing both gene and chromosome level assemblies of other species with agricultural, ecological, and evolutionary interest.},

abstract = {Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) is an important crop of temperate climates which provides nearly 30{\%} of the world's annual sugar production and is a source for bioethanol and animal feed. The species belongs to the order of Caryophylalles, is diploid with 2n = 18 chromosomes, has an estimated genome size of 714-758 megabases and shares an ancient genome triplication with other eudicot plants. Leafy beets have been cultivated since Roman times, but sugar beet is one of the most recently domesticated crops. It arose in the late eighteenth century when lines accumulating sugar in the storage root were selected from crosses made with chard and fodder beet. Here we present a reference genome sequence for sugar beet as the first non-rosid, non-asterid eudicot genome, advancing comparative genomics and phylogenetic reconstructions. The genome sequence comprises 567 megabases, of which 85{\%} could be assigned to chromosomes. The assembly covers a large proportion of the repetitive sequence content that was estimated to be 63{\%}. We predicted 27,421 protein-coding genes supported by transcript data and annotated them on the basis of sequence homology. Phylogenetic analyses provided evidence for the separation of Caryophyllales before the split of asterids and rosids, and revealed lineage-specific gene family expansions and losses. We sequenced spinach (Spinacia oleracea), another Caryophyllales species, and validated features that separate this clade from rosids and asterids. Intraspecific genomic variation was analysed based on the genome sequences of sea beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima; progenitor of all beet crops) and four additional sugar beet accessions. We identified seven million variant positions in the reference genome, and also large regions of low variability, indicating artificial selection. The sugar beet genome sequence enables the identification of genes affecting agronomically relevant traits, supports molecular breeding and maximizes the plant's potential in energy biotechnology.},

Despite its highly conserved sequence throughout vertebrates, all attempts to discover 7SK RNA homologues in invertebrate species have failed so far. Here we report on a combined experimental and computational survey that succeeded in discovering 7SK RNAs in most of the major deuterostome clades and in two protostome phyla: mollusks and annelids. Despite major efforts, no candidates were found in any of the many available ecdysozoan genomes, however. The additional sequence data confirm the evolutionary conservation and hence functional importance of the previously described 3' and 5' stem-loop motifs, and provide evidence for a third, structurally well-conserved domain.},

Our data indicate that the duck possesses a contractive immune gene repertoire, as in chicken and zebra finch, and this repertoire has been shaped through lineage-specific duplications. We identify genes that are responsive to influenza A viruses using the lung transcriptomes of control ducks and ones that were infected with either a highly pathogenic (A/duck/Hubei/49/05) or a weakly pathogenic (A/goose/Hubei/65/05) H5N1 virus. Further, we show how the duck's defense mechanisms against influenza infection have been optimized through the diversification of its $\beta$-defensin and butyrophilin-like repertoires. These analyses, in combination with the genomic and transcriptomic data, provide a resource for characterizing the interaction between host and influenza viruses.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are an abundant class of non-coding RNAs with a wide variety of cellular functions including chemical modification of RNA, telomere maintanance, pre-rRNA processing and regulatory activities in alternative splicing. The main role of box C/D snoRNAs is to determine the targets for 2'-O-ribose methylation, which is important for rRNA maturation and splicing regulation of some mRNAs. The targets are still unknown, however, for many 'orphan' snoRNAs. While a fast and efficient target predictor for box H/ACA snoRNAs is available, no comparable tool exists for box C/D snoRNAs, even though they bind to their targets in a much less complex manner.

RESULTS: PLEXY is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes thermodynamically optimal interactions of a box C/D snoRNA with a putative target RNA. Implemented as scanner for large input sequences and equipped with filters on the duplex structure, PLEXY is an efficient and reliable tool for the prediction of box C/D snoRNA target sites.

abstract = {Ribosomal and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) comprise numerous modified nucleotides. The modification patterns are retained during evolution, making it even possible to project them from yeast onto human. The stringent conservation of modification sites and the slow evolution of rRNAs and snRNAs contradicts the rapid evolution of small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) sequences. To explain this discrepancy, we investigated the coevolution of snoRNAs and their targeted sites throughout vertebrates. To measure and evaluate the conservation of RNA-RNA interactions, we defined the interaction conservation index (ICI). It combines the quality of individual interaction with the scope of its conservation in a set of species and serves as an efficient measure to evaluate the conservation of the interaction of snoRNA and target. We show that functions of homologous snoRNAs are evolutionarily stable, thus, members of the same snoRNA family guide equivalent modifications. The conservation of snoRNA sequences is high at target binding regions while the remaining sequence varies significantly. In addition to elucidating principles of correlated evolution, we were able, with the help of the ICI measure, to assign functions to previously orphan snoRNAs and to associate snoRNAs as partners to known chemical modifications unassigned to a given snoRNA. Furthermore, we used predictions of snoRNA functions in conjunction with sequence conservation to identify distant homologies. Because of the high overall entropy of snoRNA sequences, such relationships are hard to detect by means of sequence homology search methods alone.},

Based on carefully measured thermodynamic parameters, exact dynamic programming algorithms can be used to compute ground states, base pairing probabilities, as well as thermodynamic properties.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure related computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model, the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs. New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format. Updates were implemented without compromising the computational efficiency of the core algorithms and ensuring compatibility with earlier versions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The ViennaRNA Package 2.0, supporting concurrent computations via OpenMP, can be downloaded from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA.},

Upon amplification, the ncRNAs can diversify in sequence and subsequently evolve new activities, which can result in novel functions.

abstract = {The phylogeny of insects, one of the most spectacular radiations of life on earth, has received considerable attention [1-3]. However, the evolutionary roots of one intriguing group of insects, the twisted-wing parasites (Strepsiptera), remain unclear despite centuries of study and debate [1, 2, 4-11]. Strepsiptera exhibit exceptional larval developmental features, consistent with a predicted step from direct (hemimetabolous) larval development to complete metamorphosis that could have set the stage for the spectacular radiation of metamorphic (holometabolous) insects [1, 12, 13]. Here we report the sequencing of a Strepsiptera genome and show that the analysis of sequence-based genomic data (comprising more than 18 million nucleotides from nearly 4,500 genes obtained from a total of 13 insect genomes), along with genomic metacharacters, clarifies the phylogenetic origin of Strepsiptera and sheds light on the evolution of holometabolous insect development. Our results provide overwhelming support for Strepsiptera as the closest living relatives of beetles (Coleoptera). They demonstrate that the larval developmental features of Strepsiptera, reminiscent of those of hemimetabolous insects, are the result of convergence. Our analyses solve the long-standing enigma of the evolutionary roots of Strepsiptera and reveal that the holometabolous mode of insect development is more malleable than previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Both types of non-colinear RNAs are also abundant in RNA-seq of different tissue from both the African and the Indonesian coelacanth. We observe more than 8,000 lincRNAs with normal gene structure and several thousands of circularized and trans-spliced products, showing that such atypical RNAs form a substantial contribution to the transcriptome. Surprisingly, the majority of the circularizing and trans-connecting splice junctions are unique to atypical forms, that is, are not used in normal isoforms.},

abstract = {In RNAi (RNA interference), siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) are loaded into the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), which then mediates endonucleolytic cleavage of complementary target RNAs. Although RNAi has become one of the most powerful tools in molecular biology to assess gene function, there remains a great number of ineffective siRNAs. It is already known that the assembly and activation of RISC is a crucial determinant of RNAi activity, but downstream effects such as target accessibility have not been analysed extensively. Therefore we assessed the effect of target site accessibility and found that it significantly improves the potency of siRNAs. Similarly, miRNAs (microRNAs) act by repressing protein synthesis through imperfect base-pairing to the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of target mRNAs. We found that predicted target sites reside in regions of high accessibility and tested whether this criterion could be used in the search of functional miRNA targets. In addition, we performed reporter gene assays to test whether accessibility correlates with measured mRNA suppression levels. The results of our initial study suggest that secondary structures might add a so far underrepresented layer of complexity in the recognition of RNA targets by miRNAs.},

abstract = {Exophiala dermatitidis, a black yeast, is a widespread polyextremophile and human pathogen. The fungus can be isolated from extreme natural habitats and man- made extreme environments such as dishwashers or sauna facilities. It can cause various diseases ranging from cutaneous, subcutaneous and systemic infections with a fatality rate of 40{\%}. While the number of cases in immune- compromised patients is increasing, detailed understanding of the infections, virulence factors and host response is scarce. In this study an artificial skin infection on ex- vivo skin models was conducted in order to monitor the infection microscopically and analyze the changes in the transcriptome through RNA sequencing. Results show, that Exophiala dermatitidis was able to actively grow on and into ex-vivo skin models. Assembly of the RNA-sequencing data delivers a rich and complex transcriptome where circular RNAs, fusion transcripts, long non-coding RNAs and antisense transcripts are found. Changes in transcriptions primarily affected pathways related to nutrients acquisition, energy metabolism, cell wall, shape switch and secondary metabolites. Differential regulation of virulence-related genes was observed and the specific pathway for melanin upregulating during infection was determined. Hence our study is the first that gives an insight into the complexity of the transcriptome of Exophiala dermatitidis and the virulence mechanisms used by this fungus to successfully infect the ex-vivo skin models},

abstract = {Structural characteristics are essential for the functioning of many noncoding RNAs and cis-regulatory elements of mRNAs. SNPs may disrupt these structures, interfere with their molecular function, and hence cause a phenotypic effect. RNA folding algorithms can provide detailed insights into structural effects of SNPs. The global measures employed so far suffer from limited accuracy of folding programs on large RNAs and are computationally too demanding for genome-wide applications. Here, we present a strategy that focuses on the local regions of maximal structural change between mutant and wild-type. These local regions are approximated in a "screening mode" that is intended for genome-wide applications. Furthermore, localized regions are identified as those with maximal discrepancy. The mutation effects are quantified in terms of empirical P values. To this end, the RNAsnp software uses extensive precomputed tables of the distribution of SNP effects as function of length and GC content. RNAsnp thus achieves both a noise reduction and speed-up of several orders of magnitude over shuffling-based approaches. On a data set comprising 501 SNPs associated with human-inherited diseases, we predict 54 to have significant local structural effect in the untranslated region of mRNAs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE We have launched a new intervention study, called "Research of Productivity by Intergenerational Sympathy (REPRINTS)" in which senior volunteers engage in reading picture books to children. The "REPRINTS" program consistently involves social roles and intellectual activity, two higher-level functional capacities. This study reported findings and problems experienced through "REPRINTS" during the first year, ascertained potential effectiveness of social activity, and proposed methods for continued activity. METHODS Basic concepts of "REPRINTS"program include "contribution to society", "life-long learning", and "group activity." Sixty seven volunteers and 74 controls, all aged 60 years and over living in three areas, ie., Chuo-ku, central Tokyo, Kawasaki city, suburb of Tokyo and Nagahama city, a local city, participated in a baseline health check-up in June, 2004. After completion of 3-month training seminars (once a week, 2 hr per session), volunteers visited public elementary schools and kindergartens in groups of 6-10 persons for 6 months. They were assessed again by follow-up health check-up in March, 2005. RESULTS At baseline, the proportion of those who had no grand children (41.8{\%} vs. 20.3{\%}, P= 0.006), average school years (13.4 +/- 2.5 vs. 12.3 +/- 2.5 years, P= 0.008), having any experience of volunteer activities (79.1{\%} vs. 52.7{\%}, P=0.001), and an usual walking speed (86.7 +/- 12.3 vs. 81.3 +/- 12.9 m/min, P=0.012) were significantly higher in volunteers than in controls. There was no significant difference in other baseline characteristics between the two groups. At follow-up, social network scores for 56 volunteers were significantly improved: frequency of contact with grandchildren and others around neighborhood and size of circles of friends and acquaintances were increased, as compared to controls. Social support scores for the volunteers significantly decreased in the receiving aspect, while increased in the giving aspect. In addition, consciousness of loving community and self-rated health were significantly enhanced and hand-grip strength showed significantly less decline in volunteers than in controls. CONCLUSIONS Through engaging in the intergenerational and intellectual volunteer programs for 9 months, subjective health, social support and network, consciousness of loving community and some aspects of physical performance were significantly promoted in senior volunteers. Coordination of existing administrative services enabled us to establish this "REPRINTS" health promotion program for community-dwelling older adults.},

Although this limitation could be ascribed, in part, to variations in the assembly and activation of RISC, downstream events in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, such as target site accessibility, have so far not been investigated extensively. In this study we present a comprehensive analysis of target RNA structure effects on RNAi by computing the accessibility of the target site for interaction with the siRNA. Based on our observations, we developed a novel siRNA design tool, RNAxs, by combining known siRNA functionality criteria with target site accessibility. We calibrated our method on two data sets comprising 573 siRNAs for 38 genes, and tested it on an independent set of 360 siRNAs targeting four additional genes. Overall, RNAxs proves to be a robust siRNA selection tool that substantially improves the prediction of highly efficient siRNAs.},

In the case of many 'orphan' snoRNAs, the targeted nucleotides remain unknown, however. The box H/ACA subclass determines uridine residues that are to be converted into pseudouridines via specific complementary binding in a well-defined secondary structure configuration that is outside the scope of common RNA (co-)folding algorithms. RESULTS: RNAsnoop implements a dynamic programming algorithm that computes thermodynamically optimal H/ACA-RNA interactions in an efficient scanning variant. Complemented by an support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning approach to distinguish true binding sites from spurious solutions and a system to evaluate comparative information, it presents an efficient and reliable tool for the prediction of H/ACA snoRNA target sites. We apply RNAsnoop to identify the snoRNAs that are responsible for several of the remaining 'orphan' pseudouridine modifications in human rRNAs, and we assign a target to one of the five orphan H/ACA snoRNAs in Drosophila.

abstract = {The black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis is a worldwide distributed agent of primary and secondary diseases in both immunocompromised and healthy humans, with a high prevalence in human-made environments. Since thermo-tolerance has a crucial role in the fungus persistence in man-dominated habitat and in its pathogenicity, three incubation temperatures (37, 45, 1 °C) and two time spans (1 h, 1 week) were selected to simulate different environmental conditions and to investigate the effect of temperature on the proteome of E. dermatitidis CBS 525.76. Using a novel protocol for protein extraction from black yeasts, 2-D DIGE could be applied for characterization of changes in total protein spot abundance among the experimental conditions. A total of 32 variable proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Data about protein functions, localization and pathways were also obtained. A typical stress response under non-optimal temperature could not be observed at the proteome level, whereas a reduction of the metabolic activity, mostly concerning processes as the general carbon metabolism, was detected after exposure to cold. These results suggest that a fine protein modulation takes place following temperature treatment and a repertoire of stable protein might be at the base of E. dermatitidis adaptation to altered growth conditions. Significance: E. dermatitidis is a pathogenic black yeast causing neurotropic infections, systemic and subcutaneous disease in a wide range of hosts, including humans. The discovery of the fungus high prevalence in man-made habitats, including sauna facilities, drinking water and dishwashers, generated concern and raised questions about the infection route. In the present work - which is the first contribution on E. dermatitidis proteome - the effect of different temperature conditions on the fungus protein pattern have been analyzed by using a gel-based approach and the temperature responsive proteins have been identified.The absence of a typical stress response following the exposure to non-optimal temperature was detected at the proteome level, along with a general reduction of the metabolic activity after exposure to cold. These results suggest that a very fine regulation of the protein expression as well as adaptations involving a basic set of stable proteins may be at the base of E. dermatitidis enormous ecological plasticity, which plays a role in the fungus distribution, also enabling the transition from natural to human habitat and to the human host.},

Screening of these oligosaccharides as substrates for arabinosyltransferases present in mycobacterial membrane preparations suggests that modified oligosaccharide analogs as small as disaccharides may be inhibitors of glycan biosynthesis. Such inhibitors would be of potential utility as lead compounds in the identification of new drugs for the treatment of mycobacterial infections.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The ascomycetous family Chaetomiaceae (class Sordariomycetes) includes numerous soilborn, saprophytic, endophytic and pathogenic fungi which can adapt to various growth conditions and living niches by providing a broad armory of oxidative and antioxidant enzymes. RESULTS We release the 34.7 Mbp draft genome of Chaetomium cochliodes CCM F-232 consisting of 6036 contigs with an average size of 5756 bp and reconstructed its phylogeny. We show that this filamentous fungus is closely related but not identical to Chaetomium globosum and Chaetomium elatum. We screened and critically analysed this genome for open reading frames coding for essential antioxidant enzymes. It is demonstrated that the genome of C. cochliodes contains genes encoding putative enzymes from all four known heme peroxidase superfamilies including bifunctional catalase-peroxidase (KatG), cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP), manganese peroxidase, two paralogs of hybrid B peroxidases (HyBpox), cyclooxygenase, linoleate diol synthase, dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) of type B and three paralogs of heme thiolate peroxidases. Both KatG and DyP-type B are shown to be introduced into ascomycetes genomes by horizontal gene transfer from various bacteria. In addition, two putative large subunit secretory and two small-subunit typical catalases are found in C. cochliodes. We support our genomic findings with quantitative transcription analysis of nine peroxidase {\&} catalase genes. CONCLUSIONS We delineate molecular phylogeny of five distinct gene superfamilies coding for essential heme oxidoreductases in Chaetomia and from the transcription analysis the role of this antioxidant enzymatic armory for the survival of a peculiar soil ascomycete in various harsh environments.},
